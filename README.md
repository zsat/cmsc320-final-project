# cmsc320-final-project
Final project for my CMSC320 class, showcasing the Data Science pipeline. I collected data on the top 1000 Twitch streamers and created a model to predict which streamers would grow within our parameters within the next 3 months. I classified 'growing' streamers as ones that increased their follower count and watch time by 50% each from a period of 3 months to the next period of 3 months.
